# cgympoker
An online multiplayer java poker game with a swing UI for the gamers and a JSP UI for the administrator. Gamers should be able to join a tournament that will start a a specific date/time, and play in the tournament (and hope to win). Each player should receive a given amount of chips at the start of the tournament and will continue to play until the chips run out, or the player wins the tournament. The project will be written in the Eclipse IDE.
